# reporter 1.2.6 

* Added 'HTML' output type to `create_report()` and `write_report()` functions.
This was a major change that allows the user to output reports in HTML. 
By default, the HTML is in a 'paged' format, meaning it is suitable for printing.
If you want unpaged HTML, set the _paper_size_ parameter on `create_report()`
to 'none'.  This configuration will create a standard HTML web page, with all
content dumped to a single page and no page breaks.

allows the user to create titles that are bold and a larger font size
than the page body.

so the user can get borders only on the table body.

# reporter 1.2.0 

* Added Arial, Times, and Courier fonts to RTF output type.  This change required a
significant rewrite to RTF report creation functions.  Font is controlled using
the _font_ parameter on the `create_report()` function.  Old text-style RTF
output is still available using the "fixed" font.
* Added _font_size_ parameter to `create_report()` function.
* Added _valign_ parameter to `footnotes()` function.
* Added _width_ paremeter to `titles()`, `title_header()`, and `footnotes()`
functions.

`create_plot()` functions.

* Fixed line length/alignment issues on titles and footnotes.

# reporter 1.1.3 

* Made package compatible back to R 3.6.
* Added GitHub Actions for prior R version checks.
* Figured out how to generate PDF files directly, instead of using 
Latex/Rmarkdown/MikTex/Pandoc.  Will greatly reduce dependencies and make
the **reporter** package much easier to install and test.  Also makes it much
easier to accurately render the PDF file.
* Allow user to add more than one `title header()`.
* Made _output_type_ parameter case insensitive.
* Added _standard_eval_ parameter to `define()`, `spanning_header()`,
and `column_defaults()` functions.  These parameters will replace curly brace 
escape on those functions.
Curly brace escape will remain active for backward compatibility, but is 
no longer documented.
* Fixed bug in RTF that was causing page overflows in LibreOffice Writer.
* Various other bug fixes.

# reporter 1.1.2 

* Changed column width calculation to make sum of widths equal the total width of
the table.  Previously it was excluding the column gutter from the calculation.

now log results automatically when logr autolog is enabled.
* Added _underline_ parameter to `spanning_header()` to turn it on or off
* Added 8pt font
