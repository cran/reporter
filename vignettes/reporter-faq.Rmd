### What file formats does reporter support? {#types}

**Q:** I can see from the examples that the **reporter** package can create
text reports.  Can it create any other types of reports?  PDF?  DOCX?


**A:** The **reporter** package supports TXT, RTF, PDF, HTML, and DOCX
output types.

### What fonts does reporter support? {#fonts}

**Q:** I see a lot of Courier font in the examples.  Does **reporter** support
any other fonts?

**A:** The supported fonts depend on the output type selected.  Obviously for
TXT reports, no fonts are supported.  
The RTF, PDF, HTML, and DOCX output types support Courier, Arial, and Times New Roman.

### What styling options are available in the reporter package? {#styles}

**Q:** The examples show little in the way of styling: fonts, colors, bolding, 
etc.  What options are there for adding styles to the report?

**A:** The current development effort is focused on layout and output types.
Thus far in the development cycle, styling has been deprioritized. 
However, some limited styling of 
titles is available.  The `titles()` function has parameters to bold the title
block, and set the font size independently of the main report.  More styling
options will become available in 2022.

### Is there a way to control the page orientation? {#orientation}

**Q:** All of the examples I saw show a landscape page orientation.  Is there
a way to have a portrait page orientation?

**A:** Yes.  The `orientation` parameter on the `create_report()` function
accepts both "landscape" and "portrait" values.

### Is there a way to control the units of measure? {#units}

**Q:** All of the examples I saw show column widths specified in inches. 
Is there a way to specify them in metric?  What about by percentage?

**A:** The `units` parameter on the `create_report()` function allows you
to control the units of measure.  Valid values are "inches" and "cm" for 
centimeters.  The parameter accepts no other value.  The issue of setting
column widths by percentage has been raised, and is under consideration as
a future enhancement.

Note that this parameter sets the units of measure for every measurement 
on the report, not just column widths.  The units for margins, table width, 
plot width, etc. will all be understood to be in the units specified on the 
`units` parameter.  In other words, the whole report will be in either inches
or centimeters. You cannot mix measurement systems on a report.

### Can I perform statistics with reporter? {#statistics}

**Q:** With SAS® proc report, I can add statistics to my report.  Does the
**reporter** package have any statistical capabilities?

**A:** No.  The focus of the reporter package is on creating a printable
report in multiple output types.  There are many R packages to generate
statistics.  If you want statistics in your report, run your desired statistical
functions, and add the result to the input data.

### Can I perform grouping with reporter? {#grouping}

**Q:** With SAS® proc report, I can group my data in the reporting procedure.
Does the **reporter** package have grouping capabilities?

**A:** No.  There are already several ways to group data in R.  It is best
to group data with one of the existing functions before sending into the 
**reporter** package.  Note that group rows can be emphasized on the
report using the `dedupe`, `blank_after`, and `label_row` parameters on 
the `define()` function. 
See [example 2](reporter-table.html) and [example 3](reporter-stub.html) 
from the vignettes for a demonstration 
on how to use these parameters.

### Does reporter have a way to sort the report data? {#sort}

**Q:** I have some data to report on, but it is not sorted the way I want 
for reporting. Does **reporter** have any way to sort the data?

**A:** No.  There are many ways to sort data in R. It is therefore 
recommended to sort the data before sending it into the **reporter** package.

Generally speaking, the input data should be fully prepared for reporting.
The **reporter** package will take your input data pretty much as-is and 
create a report in the desired output file format.  Any data manipulation
should be done prior to reporting.

### Does reporter have a way to filter the report data? {#filter}

**Q:** I have some data to report on, but it is not filtered the way I want.
Does **reporter** have any way to filter the data?


**A:** No. There are many ways to filter data in R. It is therefore 
recommended to filter the data before sending it into the **reporter** package.

### Do I have to include all the columns in my data on the final report? {#visible}

**Q:** I have some data to report on, but it has more columns than I want to
show in the report. Does **reporter** have any way to remove some columns
from the report?

**A:** Yes.  There are two ways to remove a column from the report.  The first
is to use the `show_cols` parameter on the `create_table()` function.  This 
parameter accepts a vector of column names to include on the table.  

The second way is to use the `visible` parameter on the `define()` function.
Setting this parameter to FALSE will hide that variable on the report.

### Is there a way to order the columns on my report? {#order}

**Q:** The variables in my data are not ordered exactly as I want them
to appear on the report.  Is there a way to control column order?

**A:** Generally it is better to prepare your input data so that everything
is ordered the way you want prior to reporting. But there is a way
to order the columns if they are not in the desired order.  You can use
the `show_cols` parameter on the `create_table()` function to do this.
Simply pass a vector of column names to the `show_cols` parameter, and put
the column names in the order you want them to appear on the report.  

Note that if you are using `define()` functions, the order of these functions 
have no affect on the order of columns on the report.

### Is there a way to format a variable? {#format}

**Q:** I have variable in my input data that is not formatted.  I want to apply 
a format to it; say, round to 1 decimal place and add a percent sign.  Is there
a way to format a variable?

**A:** Yes. You can use the `format` parameter on the `define()` 
function to identify a format for a variable. The format passed to this 
parameter should be a valid format for the 
[`fapply()`](https://fmtr.r-sassy.org/reference/fapply.html) function from the 
[**fmtr**](https://fmtr.r-sassy.org) package. 
See the [`fapply()`](https://fmtr.r-sassy.org/reference/fapply.html)
documentation for additional information.

### Is there a way to control page breaks? {#breaks}

**Q:** Overall, the **reporter** package does a good job of determining
when to break to the next page.  However, sometimes I want to control exactly
when the page break occurs.  Is there a way to do that?

**A:** Yes. You can add a variable to your input data that has the desired
page number for each row.  Then use the `page_break` parameter on the `define()` 
function to identify that variable as a page break variable.  The package
will then use that variable to break pages, instead of the automatic 
paging variable.

You can also set the number of lines on a page using the `line_count`
parameter on the `options_fixed()` function.  When this parameter is set,
it will use the number of lines specified to determine when to break a page, 
instead of using the automatically calculated value.

### Is there a way to control page wraps? {#wraps}

**Q:** Overall, the **reporter** package does a good job of determining
when to wrap a page when it is too wide.  However, sometimes I want to 
control exactly when the page wrap occurs.  Is there a way to do that?

**A:** Yes. You can use the `page_wrap` parameter on the `define()` 
function to identify a variable to wrap on. See [example 6](reporter-wrap.html) 
in the documentation for an illustration of how to wrap pages.

### Is there a way to set the width of a table? {#width}

**Q:** I see there are several ways to set column widths.  However, I just 
want to set the width of the entire table, and have **reporter** figure out
the column widths proportionally.  Is there a way to do that?

**A:** Yes. You can use the `width` parameter on the `create_table()` 
function to set a width for the entire table. The width should be specified
in the units identified on the `units` parameter on the `create_report()`
function.  See the `create_table()` function documentation for more information
on the `width` parameter.
