\title{reporter: A package for creating statistical reports}
\description{
The \strong{reporter} package creates statistical reports in TXT, 
RTF, and PDF file formats.  Features include automatic page wrapping and 
breaking for wide and long tables, spanning headers, titles, footnotes, 
page headers, page footers, and page numbering.  The package allows mixing
of multiple tables, text, and plots in a single report, or even on a single
page.
}
\details{
The \strong{reporter} package creates regulatory-style, statistical reports. It 
was designed to create tables, listings, and figures (TLFs) 
for use in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical-device industries.
However, the functions are generalized enough to provide statistical reporting
for any industry.  The package is written primarily in Base R, and has 
few dependencies on other packages.

The package is intended to give R programmers 
flexible report layout capabilities, and a choice of output formats. 
The package will 
initially focus on printable, file-based 
output formats, as there are already numerous R packages that 
provide tabular reporting in HTML. 

PDF output has special installation requirements.  See \link{NotesOnPDF}
for more information.

\section{Key Features}{

The \strong{reporter} package contains the following key features:
\itemize{
  \item Titles, footnotes, page header, and page footer are repeated on each page
  \item Supports header labels and spanning headers 
  \item Calculates default columns widths automatically
  \item Includes automatic wrapping and splitting of wide and long tables
  \item Integrates with the \strong{\link[fmtr]{fmtr}} package to format 
        numeric, date, and character data
  \item Plots from the popular \strong{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot2}} package can 
        be added to RTF and PDF reports
  \item Allows appending multiple tables to a report, multiple tables to a page, 
        and intermingling of text, tables, and plots
  \item Supports in-report date/time stamps and "Page X of Y" page numbering
}
}

\section{Key Functions}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{create_report}} to define a report
  \item \code{\link{create_table}} to define a table
  \item \code{\link{create_text}} to define text content
  \item \code{\link{create_plot}} to define a plot 
  \item \code{\link{write_report}} to write out the report
}
}

\section{Package Assumptions and Limitations}{

Note that the \strong{reporter} package is built on several assumptions, and 
has some limitations.  Those
assumptions and limitations are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item The package assumes that displaying the data in the proper
  layout is more important than aesthetic considerations like colors,
  borders, fonts, striping, etc.  
  \item The current version supports a monospace, fixed-width font only.
  Variable width fonts will be supported in future versions.
  \item RTF and PDF output are actually text reports with an RTF
  or PDF wrapper.  Future versions will support native RTF and PDF file 
  formats.
  \item The package assumes that, except for formatting and layout, 
  the incoming data is ready for 
  printing. The \strong{reporter} package has no capabilities to perform 
  calculations, summaries, grouping, or derivations.  Use the many 
  capabilities in R to perform these operations prior to sending data
  to the \strong{reporter} package.
  \item It is assumed that the incoming data is sorted as desired.  
  The \strong{reporter} package
  has no capabilities for sorting.  Use the sorting functionality in 
  Base R or supplemental packages to sort the data prior to sending to
  \strong{reporter}.
  \item Titles, footnotes, page headers, and page footers must fit in the 
  available space. If they don't, the \strong{reporter} package will 
  generate an error.  In these situations, the recommended course of 
  action is to split the offending string into two or more strings that 
  fit within the available width.
  \item The \strong{reporter} package will never break a word. That means you 
  cannot set a column width that is less than the length of the longest 
  word.  If you wish to break words, add the breaks with
  \code{\link[base]{strwrap}} or an equivalent function before reporting.  
  \item The package will make a best guess on column widths based on the 
  width of the data and column headers.  To override the best guess,
  set the column width directly by placing a width attribute on the variable
  or by using the \code{\link{column_defaults}} or 
  \code{\link{define}} functions. 
  \item The max automatic column width
  is 5 inches.  Longer data values will be wrapped.
  \item The package support plots from \strong{ggplot2}. These plots
  can be added to RTF and PDF output types.  The package does not support
  Base R plots.
